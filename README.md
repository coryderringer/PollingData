# PollingData

This is a shiny app for visualizing polling data. We have several goals for the app:
  1. Visualize the function relating win probability to polling percentage (for 2-candidate races), and compare this to people's intuitions about that function (probably close to linear, maybe just a flatter version of the S curve we expect)
  2. Examine how this function changes over time; we hope to create a visual representation for the decrease in polling noise as elections get closer.
